# Project 3 : Call Center Analysis
### Project Overview
The "Call Centre Analysis" Power BI project aimed to provide comprehensive insights and visualizations related to the performance and operations of a call center. The project involved collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various sources within the call center environment to help stakeholders make informed decisions and optimize their operations. Key components and features included:

1. **Data Sources:**
   - Call Logs: Information about incoming and outgoing calls, including duration, timestamps, and caller details.
   - Agent Performance Metrics: Metrics such as call resolution time, customer satisfaction scores, and response times.
   - Customer Data: Information about customers, their history, and interactions with the call center.

2. **Key Metrics and KPIs:**
   - Average Handling Time (AHT): The average time it took for an agent to handle a call.
   - First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate: The percentage of calls resolved on the first attempt.
   - Call Volume: The number of incoming and outgoing calls over time.
   - Abandonment Rate: The percentage of calls abandoned by customers before reaching an agent.
   - Service Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance: How well the call center met agreed-upon service levels.

3. **Dashboard and Visualizations:**
   - **Call Volume Trend:** A line chart showing the trend of call volume over time, helping identify peak hours.
   - **Agent Performance Scorecards:** Visualizations showcasing individual agent performance, including AHT, FCR, and customer satisfaction scores.
   - **Customer Interaction History:** A timeline or table showing the history of interactions for a selected customer.
   - **SLA Compliance Metrics:** Gauges or indicators displaying the call center's performance against SLAs.
   - **Customer Satisfaction Heatmap:** A heatmap representing customer satisfaction scores across different times of the day or days of the week.

4. **Filters and Drill-Downs:**
   - **Time Filters:** Options to analyze data by specific time ranges (daily, weekly, monthly).
   - **Agent Filters:** Ability to drill down into the performance of individual agents.
   - **Customer Filters:** Selecting a specific customer to view their interaction history and feedback.

5. **Predictive Analytics:**
   - Machine learning models were utilized to predict future call volumes or identify potential issues before they escalated.

6. **Alerts and Notifications:**
   - Alerts were set up for key metrics to notify stakeholders when certain thresholds were exceeded or not met.

7. **Interactive Reports:**
   - Reports were created that allowed users to interact with the data, explore trends, and gain deeper insights.

8. **Data Security:**
   - Role-based access controls were implemented to ensure that sensitive information was only accessible to authorized personnel.

Through the implementation of the "Call Centre Analysis" Power BI project, organizations gained valuable insights into their call center operations, optimized resource allocation, improved customer satisfaction, and made data-driven decisions to enhance overall efficiency.
