### Project Overview
The "[Call Centre Analysis](https://github.com/OLUJUWON-OMOTOBA/Project-3/blob/main/Call%20Centre%20Analysis.pbix)" Power BI project aimed to provide comprehensive insights and visualizations related to the performance and operations of a call center. The project involved collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various sources within the call center environment to help stakeholders make informed decisions and optimize their operations. Key components and features included:

1. **Data Sources:**
   - Call Logs: Information about incoming and outgoing calls, including duration, timestamps, and caller details.
   - Agent Performance Metrics: Metrics such as call resolution time, customer satisfaction scores, and response times.
   - Customer Data: Information about customers, their history, and interactions with the call center.

2. **Key Metrics and KPIs:**
   - Average Handling Time (AHT): The average time it took for an agent to handle a call.
   - Call Resolution (CR) Rate: The percentage of calls resolved on the attempt.
   - Call Volume: The number of incoming and outgoing calls over time.
   - Abandonment Rate: The percentage of calls abandoned by customers before reaching an agent.
   - Service Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance: How well the call center met agreed-upon service levels.

3. **Dashboard and Visualizations:**
   - **Call Volume Trend:** A line chart showing the trend of call volume over time, helping identify peak hours.
   - **Agent Performance:** Visualizations showcasing individual agent performance, including AHT, FCR, and customer satisfaction scores.
   - **Customer Interaction History:** A timeline or table showing the history of interactions for a selected customer.
   - **SLA Compliance Metrics:** Gauges or indicators displaying the call center's performance against SLAs.

4. **Filters and Drill-Downs:**
   - **Time Filters:** Options to analyze data by specific time ranges (daily, weekly, monthly).
   - **Agent Filters:** Ability to drill down into the performance of individual agents.
   - **Customer Filters:** Selecting a specific customer to view their interaction history and feedback.

5. **Predictive Analytics:**
   - Machine learning models were utilized to predict future call volumes or identify potential issues before they escalated.

Through the implementation of the "Call Centre Analysis" Power BI project, organizations gained valuable insights into their call center operations, optimized resource allocation, improved customer satisfaction, and made data-driven decisions to enhance overall efficiency.
